1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,000
They say, "The holy water's
watered down

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,800
And this town's lost its faith

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,350
Our colors will fade eventually"

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,600
So, if our time is runnin' out

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,300
Day after day

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,100
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,700
Oh my, my

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Oh my, my love

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,700
I take one look at you

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
You're takin' me out of the ordinary

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,200
I want you layin' me down 'til
we're dead and buried

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,300
On the edge of your knife, stayin'
drunk on your vine

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,200
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,000
Somethin' so out of the ordinary

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,300
You got me kissin' thе ground
of your sanctuary

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,500
Shatter me with your touch,
oh Lord, return mе to dust

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,750
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Hopeless hallelujah

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
On this side of Heaven's gate

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,200
Oh, my life, how do ya

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,900
Breathe and take my breath away?

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,000
At your altar, I will pray

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,500
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,950
Oh my, my

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're takin' me out of the ordinary

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,300
I want you layin' me down 'til
we're dead and buried

27
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,100
On the edge of your knife, stayin'
drunk on your vine

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,100
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
Somethin' so out (Out) of
the ordinary (Ordinary)

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,200
You got me kissing the ground (Ground)
of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,600
Shatter me with your touch,
oh Lord, return me to dust

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,200
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,800
Somethin' so heavenly,
higher than ecstasy

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,800
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,400
World was in black and white
until I saw your light

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I thought you had to die to find

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,300
Somethin' so out of the ordinary

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,200
I want you laying me down 'til
we're dead and buried

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,000
On the edge of your knife, stayin'
drunk on your vine

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,700
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary

42
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,900
You got me kissing the ground (Ground)
of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,100
Shatter me with your touch,
oh Lord, return me to dust

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,100
The angels up in the clouds are
jealous knowin' we found
